## Hello!
My name is Giovanni, and I am a senior-year student from Indonesia.

I am an ambitious and driven student, always interested in the latest technologies and eager to learn new skills. 

Throughout my time in Stony Brook University, I have taken a variety of opportunities that have broadened my horizons and sharpened my technical skills. These include my undergraduate research in biomedical informatics and spatial computing with the WebGen VIP Team, my participation in the MATE ROV 2025 competition through the Stony Brook Robotics Team, and my role as a student technologist at DoIT's Digital Services & Experiences.

I have undertaken projects in web and mobile development, robotics, natural language processing, compiler design and systems architecture.

Outside of university, I enjoy working out and caring for my pet iguanas.
